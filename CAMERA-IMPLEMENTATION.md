# Camera Feed Implementation

## Current Status (v2.2.0) - LIVE CAMERA FEED IMPLEMENTED! ðŸŽ¥

The application now provides **REAL CAMERA FEED** using OpenCV! This is a major upgrade from the previous placeholder implementation.

## âœ… What's Working Now

### Real Camera Capture
- **OpenCV Integration**: Real camera capture using OpenCvSharp4
- **Live Video Feed**: Actual camera stream display at ~30 FPS
- **Multiple Camera Support**: Automatic detection and switching between cameras
- **Resolution Control**: Dynamic resolution adjustment (640x480, 800x600, 1280x720, etc.)

### Camera Detection
- **Smart Detection**: Combines OpenCV direct camera access with WMI device detection
- **Accessible Cameras Only**: Only shows cameras that can actually be opened
- **Fallback Support**: Multiple camera API fallbacks (OpenCV â†’ WMF â†’ DirectShow)

### Enhanced Features
- **Real-time Video**: Smooth camera feed display
- **Camera Switching**: Switch between multiple connected cameras
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if camera access fails
- **Performance Optimized**: 30 FPS capture with efficient bitmap conversion

## Implementation Details

### Primary Camera Engine: OpenCV
```csharp
// OpenCVCameraCapture.cs - Real camera capture
- Uses OpenCvSharp4 for cross-platform camera access
- Hardware-accelerated video capture
- Automatic format conversion to WPF-compatible bitmaps
- Real-time frame processing at 30 FPS
```

### Fallback Systems
1. **OpenCV** (Primary) - Real camera feed
2. **Windows Media Foundation** (Secondary) - Native Windows API
3. **DirectShow** (Tertiary) - Legacy Windows camera API
4. **Placeholder** (Emergency) - Shows camera detected but no video

### Smart Camera Detection
```csharp
// Enhanced detection in VideoCaptureElement.cs
1. OpenCV: Tests actual camera accessibility
2. WMI: Gets device information and names
3. Combined: Creates unified camera list
```

## Current Features That Work
- âœ… **REAL CAMERA FEED** - Live video from connected cameras
- âœ… Camera detection and listing
- âœ… Multiple camera switching
- âœ… Window positioning and sizing
- âœ… Settings persistence
- âœ… Real-time size display
- âœ… Right-click context menu
- âœ… Resolution selection with live preview
- âœ… Always-on-top behavior
- âœ… Smooth 30 FPS video capture
- âœ… Automatic camera format detection

## Installation Requirements

### NuGet Packages Added
```xml
<PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4" Version="4.10.0.20241020" />
<PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4.runtime.win" Version="4.10.0.20241020" />
<PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4.WpfExtensions" Version="4.10.0.20241020" />
```

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Connected camera (USB webcam, built-in camera, etc.)
- .NET 9.0 runtime
- Camera permissions enabled in Windows Privacy settings

## What Users See Now
- **Live camera feed** in the overlay window
- Smooth video at 30 FPS
- Multiple camera selection from right-click menu
- Real-time resolution changes
- Actual camera names (e.g., "Camera 1 (OpenCV)")
- Professional camera overlay experience

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- Hardware-accelerated OpenCV capture
- Efficient bitmap conversion using OpenCvSharp4.WpfExtensions
- Async camera initialization
- Proper resource disposal

### Reliability
- Multiple API fallbacks
- Comprehensive error handling
- Camera access validation
- Graceful degradation

### User Experience
- Instant camera switching
- Live resolution preview
- Smooth video playback
- No lag or stuttering

The application is now a **fully functional camera overlay** with real camera capture capabilities!
