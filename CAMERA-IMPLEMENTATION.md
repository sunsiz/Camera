# Camera Feed Implementation Notes

## Current Status (v1.4.0)
The application successfully detects cameras but shows a placeholder instead of actual video feed.

## Why No Video Feed?
The current implementation is a **placeholder** that demonstrates the application framework. Actual camera capture requires:

1. **DirectShow COM Integration** (Windows native)
2. **Media Foundation APIs** (Windows modern)
3. **Third-party libraries** (like AForge.NET, OpenCV, etc.)

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: DirectShow (Recommended for Windows)
```csharp
// Requires DirectShow COM interop
// Complex but provides full camera control
// Native Windows camera API
```

### Option 2: Media Foundation
```csharp
// Modern Windows API
// Better performance
// Requires Windows 10/11
```

### Option 3: Third-party Libraries
```csharp
// AForge.NET - Simple but older
// OpenCV - Powerful but complex
// MediaFoundation.NET - Wrapper library
```

## Next Steps to Add Real Camera Feed

1. **Choose Implementation**: DirectShow recommended for Windows
2. **Add NuGet Packages**: Media Foundation or DirectShow wrappers
3. **Implement Video Capture**: Replace placeholder with actual capture
4. **Handle Camera Permissions**: Windows camera privacy settings
5. **Add Error Handling**: Camera busy, permissions denied, etc.

## Current Features That Work
- ✅ Camera detection and listing
- ✅ Window positioning and sizing
- ✅ Settings persistence
- ✅ Real-time size display
- ✅ Right-click context menu
- ✅ Resolution selection (window resizing)
- ✅ Always-on-top behavior

## What Users See Now
- Camera is detected and listed correctly
- Window shows camera name and current size
- Clear indication that video feed is placeholder
- All window management features work perfectly

The application is fully functional as a camera overlay framework - it just needs the actual video capture implementation added.
