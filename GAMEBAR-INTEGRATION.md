### Keyboard Shortcuts (Still Available)

## 🔧 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Windows 10** (version 1903+) or **Windows 11**
- **Game Bar enabled** in Windows Settings
- **Recording permissions** granted to Game Bar

### Game Bar Settings
1. Open **Windows Settings** > **Gaming** > **Game Bar**
2. Ensure **"Record game clips..."** is **ON**
3. Check **"Show Game Bar when I play full screen games..."** is **ON**
4. Verify **microphone** and **camera** permissions if needed

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Recording Doesn't Start
1. **Try Manual**: Use Win+Alt+R keyboard shortcut
2. **Check Game Bar**: Press Win+G to verify Game Bar works
3. **Enable Game Bar**: Go to Windows Settings > Gaming > Game Bar
4. **App Recognition**: Game Bar needs to recognize this as a "game" - the overlay should qualify

### Common Issues
