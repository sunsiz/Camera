# Camera Overlay v1.9.1 Release Notes

## Enhanced Device Validation (v1.9.1)

### Key Improvements
- **Improved Device Validation Logic**: Enhanced the `ValidateDeviceDetails()` method to use multiple approaches for camera validation
- **Better Error Handling**: More robust device lookup with fallback methods
- **Detailed Debug Output**: Enhanced debugging information for troubleshooting camera detection issues

### Technical Changes
- Multiple device validation approaches:
  1. Direct DeviceID lookup (primary method)
  2. Name-based search (fallback method)  
  3. Assumption of validity (if device passed initial detection)
- Better error handling during validation
- More comprehensive debug logging

### Expected Behavior
✅ **CAMERA READY Status**: Valid cameras should now properly show green "CAMERA READY" status instead of yellow "CAMERA DETECTED"

✅ **DFU Filtering**: Non-functional DFU (Device Firmware Update) devices continue to be filtered out

✅ **Debug Console**: Right-click to toggle detailed diagnostic information

### Testing Instructions
1. Run `run-camera-overlay-v1.9.1.bat`
2. Look for green "✅ CAMERA READY" status on detected cameras
3. Check debug console for detailed validation steps
4. Verify DFU devices are not listed

### Known Limitations
- Video feed is still placeholder (requires DirectShow/MediaFoundation integration)
- Actual camera capture would need additional API implementation
- This version focuses on proper device detection and status display

### Version History
- v1.9.1: Enhanced device validation for proper "CAMERA READY" status
- v1.9.0: Added comprehensive camera access validation methods
- v1.8.0: Integrated debug console for real-time diagnostics
- v1.7.0: Enhanced DFU device filtering

Report any issues or unexpected behavior via debug console output.
