# Camera Icon Instructions

Since I cannot create binary ICO files directly, please follow these steps:

1. **Download a camera icon** from a free icon website like:
   - https://www.flaticon.com (search for "camera" or "video camera")
   - https://icons8.com (search for "camera")
   - https://www.iconfinder.com (search for "camera recording")

2. **Convert to ICO format** using:
   - Online converter: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
   - Or use GIMP, Paint.NET, or similar software

3. **Save as**: `camera-icon.ico` in the project root directory

4. **Recommended icon**: Look for icons with camera + recording/video themes

**Alternative**: Remove the ApplicationIcon line from the .csproj file if you don't want a custom icon.

**Icon Requirements**:
- Format: .ICO file
- Size: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 pixels (multi-resolution ICO)
- Theme: Camera, video recording, or screen recording related
